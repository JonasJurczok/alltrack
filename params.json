There are hundreds of apps out there that do specific tracking for you: weight, running time, money spending etc. But what about generic things? Number of people you talked to during a day? Number of people who attend your talks?\r\n\r\nEither you install (and find!) a specific solution to this problem or you use AllTrack. With this application you can configure multiple datasets and then add values to them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
