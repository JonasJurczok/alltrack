# AllTrack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JonasJurczok/alltrack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JonasJurczok/alltrack)

AllTrack is an Android app that solves one problem that bugged me for a long time: general tracking of things.
There are hundreds of apps out there that do specific tracking for you: weight, running time, money spending etc.
But what about generic things? Number of people you talked to during a day? Number of people who attend your talks?

Either you install (and find!) a specific solution to this problem or you use AllTrack.
With this application you can configure multiple datasets and then add values to them.


# TODO
- create dataset
- add value to dataset
- group datasets together
- visualize single dataset
- visualize groups
- create widget for easy adding of values
